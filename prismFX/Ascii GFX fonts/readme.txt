Select the font file desired.
Copy it to enFont3.h in this folder's parent folder

Notes:
sans	9,12,28,24
serif	9,12,18,24

Printing mixed TH and EN characters works well.
Using significantly different size fonts for the two fonts will look odd if mixed.

Note: the font files from the OLED_GFX and dot_GFX are NOT compatible with Prism_GFX!
